Once upon a time, there
was a man named Ronald
McDonald. He ruled over the
Hamburger Kingdom, where he met
the evil dictator, Lady Wendy.
He began to formulate his
plan to take over her chicken
nuggets by stealing her secret
formula. The plan was to
gather all the infinity sauces:
BBQ, Buffallo, Honey Mustard, Ranch
and Sweet & Sour. These
sauces would give Ronald McDonald
the power to create perfect
clown soldiers and give himself
cooking skills better than Wendy's.
He cheffed up some fire
chicken nuggets to present to
Wendy, and she was blown away.
