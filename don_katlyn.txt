On a Wednesday afternoon, we
were abducted by green aliens
and played poker until midnight.
The next morning we went and got
breakfast at Denny's.
The aliens ate lots of silverware, 
napkins, and garbage slowly.
They tried to offer us a tasty fork, 
we declined.
Suddenly they became angry and challenged 
us to a dance-off!
They began with the macarena, we challenged 
with the electric slide.
They were astonished by our moves! We won and 
were dubbed...
The eternal intergalactic dance champions.
